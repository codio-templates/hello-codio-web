# Files

Students will need HTML, CSS, and JS files in their project before beginning. Students can either create their own files, or file templates can be uploaded. Click on `File` in the menu bar and then select `New File...` to create a blank, new file. Click on `Upload...` if there are pre-made files for the students.

In the file tree to the left, you should see all of the files needed for web development. **Note**, it is not necessary to have the JS libraries local to the project.

### P5.js
This demo is using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org) library. P5 differs in a few ways from traditional JS libraries. First, P5 does not use the traditional [namespace](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode) conventions. By default, everything is global. P5 also uses the sketch metaphor for projects created in P5, which is why the JS file is called `sketch.js`.
