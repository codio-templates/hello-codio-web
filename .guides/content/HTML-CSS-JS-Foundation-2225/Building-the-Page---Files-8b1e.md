# Files

Students will need HTML, CSS, and JS files in their project before beginning. Students can either create their own files, or file templates can be uploaded. Click on `File` in the menu bar and then select `New File...` to create a blank, new file. Click on `Upload...` if there are pre-made files for the students.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<div style="width:200px; height:450px; margin-left:120px">

![The Codio file menu has options for new file and file upload](.guides/img/file-upload.png)


</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In the file tree to the left, you should see all of the files needed for web development. **Note**, it is not necessary to have the JS libraries local to the project.

![The file tree contains the HTML file index.html, the JS libraries p5.dom.min.js, p5.min.js and p5.sound.min.js. It also contains the JS file sketch.js and the CSS file style.css](.guides/img/web-files.png)

### Students and the File Tree

Because several files are needed for web development, students may need access to the file tree. You provide students access to the file tree in the **Layout** [settings](https://docs.codio.com/instructors/authoring/guides/page_editing.html#layout).



### P5.js
This demo is using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org) library. P5 differs in a few ways from traditional JS libraries. First, P5 does not use the traditional [namespace](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode) conventions. By default, everything is global. P5 also uses the sketch metaphor for projects created in P5, which is why the JS file is called `sketch.js`.
