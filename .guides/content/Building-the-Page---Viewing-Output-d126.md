# Viewing Output

Return to the Guide Editor and click on the Preview button in the top-right corner. This switches to preview mode, where you can see the content from the student's point of view. All of the coding files should be grouped together. You can click on the appropriate tab to access each file. The order of the tabs is the same as the `Open Tabs` section of settings. After making changes to the code, click the icon with two blue arrows to refresh the output.
