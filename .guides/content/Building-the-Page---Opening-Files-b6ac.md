# Opening Files

In addition to selecting the layout of the guide, Codio also allows you to determine which files should be opened. After selection your layout, In the `Open Tabs` section you can drag files to add them or click on the "Add Tab" button  and select the tab type.


You will need to add four new tabs. One for the HTML file, one for the CSS file, another for the JS file, and finally one to preview the output of the web page. To keep all of the coding files together, put them into the same column or panel. Notice that the tab for output has a different type. Select `Preview` (the eye icon) from the list of options, and be sure to put it in its own column or panel.
